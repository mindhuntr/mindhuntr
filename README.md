**mindhuntr (Writer, Linux Enthusiast and Student of Psychology)**

I am an undergraduate student of psychology with a penchant for Linux and System Administration.  I have always been fascinated by the influence technology has come to exert in the course of human lives, in some ways even to our detriment. I hope to discover the proper means to weild technological tools and strive to build an ecosystem where the machine remains subordinate to its users.

## ðŸ“Ÿ Foray into the UNIX World 

I chanced upon Linux 4 years ago when one of my friends introduced me to Capture the Flags (CTFs). Although I was initially disenchanted by looking at someone navigate a system using the command line, I quickly understood how superior it was compared to a GUI. I started with a few Reverse Engineering challenges in [w3challs](https://w3challs.com/profile/mindhunter) where I learned Assembly, C Programming and a lot of bashing scripting. Since then I have picked up a variety of programming languages and tools that have helped me foster an environment devoid of the mindlessness in the modern internet. I also actively participate in the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/), a collection of communities centered around UNIX based operating systems. They provide shell account services, web hosting and also provisions for alternative protocols like gemini and gopher.
