**mindhuntr (Writer, Linux Enthusiast and Student of Psychology)**

I am an undergraduate student of psychology with a penchant for Linux and System Administration.  I have always been fascinated by the influence technology has come to decisively influence the course of human lives, in some ways even to our detriment. I hope to discover the proper means to weild technological tools and strive to build an eco system where the machine remains subordinate to its users.
